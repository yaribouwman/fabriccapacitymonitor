# Documentation Standards

All documentation in this project should read like internal engineering documentation, not a blog post or tutorial.

## Style Guide

### Tone
- Direct and concise
- Assume the reader is a competent engineer
- No filler sentences or restating the obvious
- No phrases like "In this section we will discuss" or "Let's take a look at"

### Formatting
- Use mermaid for diagrams (architecture, flows, sequences)
- Use tables for structured comparisons
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use markdown headings correctly (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)

### Prohibited
- No emoji anywhere in documentation
- No ASCII art banners or decorative borders
- No excessive markdown formatting (bold/italic for emphasis only)
- No "AI slop" patterns: corporate buzzwords, verbose explanations, tutorial-style prose

## Documentation Types

### README.md
- Under 100 lines total
- Three sections: What, How, Security
- Link to `docs/` for anything longer than a paragraph
- Include Deploy to Azure button
- Include basic setup instructions

### Architecture Docs (docs/architecture.md)
- High-level component diagram
- Network topology with CIDR ranges
- Data flow diagram
- Trust boundaries and security zones
- One page a new engineer reads on day one

### Decision Records (docs/decisions.md)
- ADR-style format
- One entry per major decision
- Include: context, decision, rationale, tradeoffs, status
- Short (2-3 paragraphs per decision)
- Focus on "why" over "what"

### How-To Guides (docs/howto.md)
- Step-by-step operational procedures
- Assumes reader has basic Azure knowledge
- Include copy-paste commands where appropriate
- No hand-holding or excessive explanation

## Code Comments

Apply the same standards to inline code comments:
- Only comment the "why", never the "what"
- Well-named variables and functions should be self-documenting
- Comment non-obvious choices, workarounds, or performance considerations
- One-line comments preferred, multi-line only when necessary

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Keep first line under 72 characters. Add body if context is needed.
