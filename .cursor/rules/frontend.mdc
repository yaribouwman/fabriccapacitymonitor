# Frontend Rules

Placeholder for future frontend development.

## Current State

The initial product is a backend API that ingests Microsoft Fabric capacity metrics and stores them in PostgreSQL. The frontend will evolve in two phases:

### Phase 1: Power BI Report (Public)
- Embedded Power BI report consuming data from the backend API
- Read-only view of capacity metrics
- No authentication required for self-hosted deployments

### Phase 2: SaaS Frontend (Private, Upsell)
- Web application for organizations that don't want to self-host
- Additional premium features (alerting, custom dashboards, historical trends)
- Subscription-based pricing
- Multi-tenant architecture

## Future Conventions

Once frontend development begins:
- Framework TBD (likely React or Vue)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Minimal UI framework (TailwindCSS or similar)
- Component-driven architecture
- Same code quality bar: no over-commenting, no emoji, human-written code

This file will be updated when frontend development starts.
